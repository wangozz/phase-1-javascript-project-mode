        We are a social outreach program that seeks to combat mental health issues in the community.
        We do so by providing a platform where individuals get an opportunity to express themselves and assess their wellbeing from a third person point of view.
        We also give access various resources where they can learn to combat various mental obstacles.
        We believe that change starts with you and as much as we may not solve the problem at least you are a step closer to the solution.
